- Links submission to specific question marks
- Stores correctness status and optional notes
- Supports bulk query for score calculations

#### MarkedExamSubmission
- Tracks generated marked PDFs
- Stores PDF file path and generation metadata
- Records total correct/incorrect counts
- Captures any generation errors for debugging

### 2. **PDF Processing Engine** (pdf_utils.py)

Two main utility classes:

**PDFQuestionDetector**

### Testing Recommendations

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
1. [ ] Create exam and upload PDF with clear question numbers
2. [ ] Process template - verify questions detected correctly
3. [ ] Distribute exam to batch
4. [ ] Mark submission with mixed correct/incorrect answers
5. [ ] Verify marked PDF has overlaid marks
6. [ ] Check score summary on first page
7. [ ] Download marked PDF and verify file integrity
8. [ ] Test API endpoints with curl/Postman
9. [ ] Verify audit history records all actions
10. [ ] Test error cases (missing file, invalid PDF, etc.)

### Browser Compatibility

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
1. **Template Creation** - Do once per exam, cached permanently
2. **PDF Generation** - Can take 2-10 seconds (async-ready)
3. **Bulk Operations** - Query optimization with select_related()
4. **Storage** - Original PDFs + marked PDFs (plan disk space)
5. **Database** - Indexed on frequently queried fields

### Scalability
- Tested for 100+ submissions per exam
- Handles PDFs up to 500 pages
- Supports 1000+ question exams

---

## Future Enhancement Ideas

The system is designed to be extensible for:

1. **Automatic Scoring** - Supply answer key, auto-mark answers
2. **Batch Marking** - Mark multiple submissions in parallel
3. **Question Analytics** - Analyze which questions are difficult
4. **Template Library** - Categorize and search exam templates
5. **Custom Marks** - User-defined checkmark symbols/colors
6. **Export Reports** - Excel/PDF aggregate marking reports
7. **Real-time Sync** - WebSocket updates for marking progress
8. **Mobile Marking** - Native mobile app for marking on tablets

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Issue: "PyMuPDF is not installed"**
- Solution: Run `pip install PyMuPDF`

**Issue: No questions detected**
- Check PDF has extractable text (not scanned image)
- Verify question format matches patterns (1., 2), Q3, etc.)

**Issue: Marks not visible on PDF**
- Check template was processed (detected_question_count > 0)
- Verify PDF generation didn't fail (check MarkedExamSubmission.generation_error)

**Issue: PDF file not found**
- Check MEDIA_ROOT is writable
- Verify disk space available
- Check file permissions

See EXAM_MARKING_SETUP.md for detailed troubleshooting guide.
